[i]Automatically shuts down the server when no players are online, saving resources and keeping things clean.[/i]

[b] Description[/b]

EmptyServerShutdown is a server-side plugin that [b]monitors player activity[/b] and shuts down the server when it's empty. It waits a configurable amount of time to allow players to reconnect. If no one joins in time, the [b]world is saved[/b] and the [b]server shuts down automatically[/b].

[i]Optional:[/i] The shutdown timer can also start right when the server starts up, to avoid leaving it running indefinitely if no one joins.
